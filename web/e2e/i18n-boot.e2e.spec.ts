/**
 * The app must not render before it can speak.
 *
 * TranslocoPipe reports a late-arriving translation with ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck(), which
 * marks the view dirty but schedules no change-detection run in a zoneless app. Anything rendered
 * before the translation file landed therefore kept its empty string until some unrelated event
 * happened to run change detection — permanently, from the user's point of view. It cost the tab
 * bar and the up-link their accessible names, both of which the design language makes a contract
 * (UI-Designsprache §8.1, §8.6).
 *
 * The guard is the boot order, so the test attacks the boot order: hold the translation file back
 * well past first paint and assert the labels are right anyway, WITHOUT interacting with the page.
 * A click would run change detection and hide the very defect this covers.
