/**

 * foundation; voting is optional and says so in the product's own copy, twice; deleting happens in
 * someone else's system and cannot be undone (PRODUCT.md, principle 4). The `span` and the rule's
 * colour carry that ranking, so the layout says what the words say.

/**
 * The genuine sequence: nothing can be measured before the channel is joined, and nothing can be
 * purged before it was measured. Numbering earns its place here because the order carries
 * information — unlike the decorative 01/02/03 that the same layout usually gets.
 *
 * Two of the four carry a note. Both are frictions the product actually has (PRODUCT.md, "Operating
 * Context"): the tool is legitimately empty for the first days, and the 7TV write token has to be
 * copied out of the browser's devtools because 7TV offers no login redirect. Naming them on the
 * public page is the trust the page owes; hiding them would only move the surprise later.
