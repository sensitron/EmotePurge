/**
 * The first spec in this repo that mounts a routed *page* component rather than a service, guard,
 * dialog or a shared/ presentational piece — no established pattern existed for this (see the
 * feasibility spike this file grew out of), so a few choices here are worth spelling out for
 * whoever touches `UsageStatsPage` next.
 *
 * **The template is replaced, not the logic.** `TestBed.overrideComponent` swaps the real 825-line
 * template — the whole atlas/sidecar/dock component graph, each with its own dependencies — for two
 * bare `<div>`s. That is not disabling behaviour under test: it exists purely so the constructor's
 * `viewChild.required<ElementRef>('sheet')`/`('stickyBar')` reads succeed and their `ResizeObserver`
 * effects can attach to *something*, instead of throwing `NG0951` for a ref the real template would
 * only ever satisfy through components this test has no reason to construct. Every signal, computed,
 * effect and HTTP call in the class itself runs unmodified.
 *
 * **The HTTP round sequence and the two `fixture.detectChanges()` calls are load()'s choreography,
 * not this spec's.** `load()` fires `getSetStatus` unconditionally, then only fires `getTotals`/
 * `getChannelSeries` once `rangeResolved` is true — which for the "all time" default requires a
 * *second* effect run after the tracked-since date corrects `from()` (see that effect's own comment
 * in usage-stats-page.ts). This spec has to flush requests and tick change detection in the same
 * order and count `load()` actually produces. A refactor of `load()`, the "all time" effect, or
 * `refreshSetStatus()` itself will very likely change how many HTTP round trips happen and in what
 * order — when that happens, adjust the flushing choreography below to match the new sequence, not
 * the assertions at the end of the test, which are the actual thing under test.
 *
 * There are three cases below, not one. The first two cover the discard branch — A's stale answer
 * can land in either of two windows, before B's own load has finished or after, and only the
 * second is the shape #112 actually reported: it is the one where `setStatusChannel` has already
 * been bumped to `'b'` by B's own success before A's answer arrives, which is what let the pre-fix
 * code's unconditional `setStatus.set(status)` slip A's set id in under a
 * `setStatusChannel`/`importScopeCurrent` that still read as correct. The third case covers the
 * other branch of the same `if` — the successful silent refresh that *does* get to claim the
 * channel, which is the other half of the fix (`setStatusChannel` being written at all, not just
 * being guarded).
