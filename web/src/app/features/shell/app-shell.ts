           filter toolbars at top-24, both assuming exactly this header height (design doc §8.5).
           z-30 keeps the header (and its mobile disclosure) above the z-20 sticky bars — it is a
           utility here so it beats .app-sticky-bar's own z-20 (utilities layer after components).
           Reusing that class rather than repeating the blur: the translucency has to be denser in
           light than in dark, and --ep-sticky-alpha is where that lives. -->

          <!-- max-w-5xl here and on <main> is ONE width for the whole app, deliberately. A
               per-route second width for the two sprite sheets was built and taken out again the
               same day: the extra pixels really are emote columns there, but they cost a frame that
               jumps on every navigation between a sheet page and a list page, and that is the worse
               deal. If the sheets get their width back, it has to be without moving the frame.

               Logo and the worker warning form one anchored group — a lone justify-between middle
               child would float detached between logo and menu button on narrow viewports. -->
          <!-- relative + the popover anchor sit on the whole left group, not on the quota badge
               inside it. Anchoring to the badge made the panel's position follow the badge's, which
               moves with the locale: "Votes" is shorter than "Abstimmungen", so in en the wordmark
               keeps more width, the badge starts further right and the panel ran 27px past the
               right edge at 360px (measured). Anchored here, left-0 is the header's own left
               padding in every locale, and the panel's max-w keeps it inside the viewport from
               there. -->

                 lands on top of whatever sits on the right. The logo keeps its size; only the

                 design language forbids twice over (both in §4.3): a marker present on every screen
                 in every session marks nothing, and a healthy subsystem stays quiet so the first
                 unhealthy one is the loudest thing on screen without shouting. The header holds the
                 stricter version of that rule — HealthMarker's own quiet state is a dot plus a
                 word, and even that is more than an app frame should spend on "as expected".
                 'unknown' stays silent too: it is the state before the first poll answers, so
                 speaking there would flash a warning on every cold load. -->

                 until now a page whose live stream was refused simply went still, and still is
                 indistinguishable from "nothing is happening" — which is the whole complaint in
                 issue #42. It belongs in the frame and not on a page (§4.4): every page updates
                 itself from that stream, so the fact is app-wide, and app-wide facts are the
                 header's alone.
                 Only ever shown for a full *per-login* budget, never for a transient close: a
                 restarted Api or a dropped proxy connection puts every stream through 'closed' on
                 the way back up, and a warning that flashes on every deploy is one people learn to
                 ignore (§4.3). LiveQuotaService confirms the cause with the server before this can
                 appear at all.

                 The label is short for a reason the header enforces rather than prefers, and the
                 audit harness measured it: at 360px one badge already truncates the wordmark to
                 3px (shell-both-warnings). The cause ("zu viele offene Tabs") therefore lives one
                 click down, in the popover.

                 The announcement is deliberately NOT inside the @if below: this state appears
                 *after* load, and a live region that only comes into existence with its content
                 announces nothing. Permanent and sr-only, so it can exist without adding an empty
                 flex child (and its gap) to the row. It also keeps speaking when the badge yields
                 its space below — a screen reader has no 360px to run out of, so there is no reason
                 to make it share the header's scarcity. -->

                 "Abstimmungen" out of the row and gets clipped by the account trigger. The worker
                 warning wins because it outranks this one — "Chat wird nicht gezählt" is data being
                 lost for good, while paused live updates are a stale view that a reload fixes. -->

                         edge at roughly -116px and clipped the first third of every line. Neither
                         horizontalOverflowPx nor beyondRightEdge sees that — overflow to the left
                         does not lengthen scrollWidth — which is why this was caught in the audit
                         screenshot and not in its metrics. Left-aligned, the panel runs from the
