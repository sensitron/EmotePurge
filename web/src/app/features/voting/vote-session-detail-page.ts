 * had on the old card (40 px), the vote buttons keep their 44 px height, and three fit across a
 * phone where two cards did.
 *
 * Above that width the pointer is precise and the reader is usually a moderator working through the
 * result, so the dense 64 px cell takes over.
 *
 * The threshold is measured against the CONTAINER, not the viewport — the sheet sits next to a
 * sidecar from `lg` up, so the window's width says nothing about the room the cells actually have.
