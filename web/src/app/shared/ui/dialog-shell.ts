/**
 * The inside of every CDK dialog: surface, padding, heading, body, action row.
 *
 * The hull (`rounded-lg bg-surface p-6 shadow-overlay`) stood hand-written in nine components, and
 * around it the details had drifted the way copies do — five heading variants, three heading
 * margins, two of the nine with no heading and therefore no accessible name at all.
 *
 * Spacing is the shell's job, not the caller's: the body is a flex column, so a dialog composes its
 * content out of siblings instead of stacking `mb-*` on each one. Content that belongs together
 * more tightly than the default rhythm wraps itself in its own `flex flex-col gap-1`.
 *
 * The width comes from `.cdk-overlay-pane.app-dialog-panel` (styles.css) — the pane owns it, not the
 * content. Three dialogs used to also set their own `w-[26rem]`/`w-[28rem]`, which either matched
 * the pane cap or silently fought it.
 *
 * On a coarse pointer the same dialog is a bottom sheet: the pane's geometry comes from a media
 * query in styles.css, and what is added here is the chrome that only a sheet has — a grab handle
 * and the drag that dismisses it. Sticky, because the pane is the scroll container, and a handle
 * that scrolls out of reach is not a handle. (`-top-6` is what makes that pin land flush: it
 * cancels the `-mt-6` that bleeds the handle over the hull's own top padding.)
 *
 * The handle carries the hull's own `rounded-t-2xl`, because its negative margins bleed it into the
 * corner areas the hull's radius leaves unpainted — without it the sheet reads square-topped and the
 * hull's radius is invisible. `overflow-hidden` on the hull would fix it too and must not be used:
 * it would make the hull a scroll container of its own and break the handle's sticky pin.
 *
 * The handle is sized as a touch target, not around its 4-px bar: `min-h-11` is the 44-px comfort
 * target from the design language (§10). SheetDrag also starts a drag anywhere in a sheet that is
 * scrolled to the top, but that only survives on a pane with nothing to scroll — as soon as the
 * content is longer than the sheet, the browser claims a downward touch as a scroll and cancels the
 * pointer. On a real phone the handle is therefore the reliable grab area, and at the bar's own
 * height it was 24 px of it.
 *
 * The heading block is the second grab area, for the same reason and because that is what a native
 * sheet does. `data-sheet-handle` on the wrapper makes it one — that also lifts the scroll-position
 * check, deliberately: a drag started on the heading means the sheet, never the content. `contents`
 * on a fine pointer keeps the wrapper out of the layout entirely, so the desktop dialog is boxed
 * exactly as before and a dialog that renders neither heading form cannot collect a stray gap.
