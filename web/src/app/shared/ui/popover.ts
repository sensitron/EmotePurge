 * guarding against overflowing a 360 px viewport.
 *
 * Deliberately not a CDK overlay: these panels open out of a sticky filter toolbar and must inherit
 * its stacking context (design doc §8.5), which a container appended to `<body>` cannot. Modal
 * surfaces stay `@angular/cdk/dialog`'s job (§7) — this primitive is for the non-modal case and
 * carries no focus trap.
 *
 * Contract with the host: rendered = open. The panel never hides itself; it emits `closed` (outside
 * click, Escape) and the host owns the visibility signal. The host also owns focus return — the
 * panel does not know which element opened it. Bring your own padding: the panel is padding-free so
 * full-bleed rows (menus) and padded forms can both live in it.
