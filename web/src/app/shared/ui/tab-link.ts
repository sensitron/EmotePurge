/**
 * One tab in an in-page tab bar.
 *
 * The pattern was correct and copied by hand seven times — three tabs in the channel workspace,
 * four in the admin area — each carrying the same two-line class ternary inline. Nothing was wrong
 * with any single copy; the problem is that the design language calls the tab bar a cross-page
 * contract (§8.1, §8.5) and a contract that lives in seven pasted string literals drifts the first
 * time one of them is edited.
 *
 * `display: contents` on the host: the bar is a flex row with a fixed height, and the anchor has to
 * be the flex child itself for `items-center` to carry that height exactly. A wrapper element would
 * become the flex child and the anchor would centre inside a box of its own.
