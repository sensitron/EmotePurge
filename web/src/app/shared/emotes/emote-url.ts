/**
 * The animated counterpart of a stored emote url, for the one place that shows a single emote.
 *
 * Every emote reaches the frontend as the 4x *still* (`SevenTvEmoteJsonMapper.BuildImageUrl`),
 * because the atlas draws hundreds of cells at once and the animated frames of a 64 px emote run to
 * 133 KB on average and 1.2 MB at the top — 73 MB for one large set against 15 MB as stills.
 * The sidecar and the readout line show one emote at a time, so there the animation costs a single
 * request and is worth having.
 *
 * The `_static` marker in the stored url is what carries the distinction: 7TV emits it in the
 * file's own `static_name` and only for an animated emote, so a url without it belongs to a still
 * emote that has no animation to upgrade to. That makes this a total function with no flag to
 * thread through the DTOs — but it also means the marker is load-bearing, and the mapper says so.
 *
 * 2x rather than 4x on purpose: the sidecar renders at 56 px and the readout at 28 px, so 4x buys
 * no sharpness there and doubles the worst case (2.5 MB against 1.2 MB for a single hover).
