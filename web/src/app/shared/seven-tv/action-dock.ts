/**
 * The usage-stats action dock is not one block: it renders a *marking* half (the marked count, the
 * mass-delete panel and the vote-session button projected into it) and an *import* half
 * (`app-import-progress-section`), and each carries its own gate in the template. The marking half
 * needs this channel to have an active 7TV set — there is nothing to mark slots against without
 * one — while the import half deliberately does not, because a copy run writes into *another*
 * channel's set and has to stay visible, Cancel button included, on every usage-stats page it is
 * opened from (R9).
 *
 * Mounting the bar on "something is selected" alone therefore has an empty state: a transient 5xx on
 * `GET …/emote-set` leaves the grid standing with no set status, and the first click on a cell then
 * produced an accent-framed bar with nothing in it, plus the `pb-40` of empty space the page keeps
 * free for it. This function is what the bar and that padding are bound to instead.
 *
 * Pure rather than inlined in the page's `computed`, so the empty-bar case can be pinned by a test
 * that does not have to stand the whole usage-stats page up in a TestBed.
