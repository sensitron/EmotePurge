/**
 * True for an alias 7TV is known to reject when adding an emote to the target set. This tests
 * `row.name` in its role as the `alias` an `addEmote` mutation sends (#149/T2) — not 7TV's
 * separate, stricter validator for the canonical emote name, which this preview does not touch.
 *
 * This used to claim non-ASCII aliases were doomed ("the alias is not affected — 7TV does allow
 * umlauts there" was the previous wording here, and it was wrong: the two live rejections it cited,
 * `Hänno` and `HörMalZuBrudi`, were themselves alias rejections, not name rejections). What was
 * actually true is narrower: 7TV `v3`'s alias validator rejects every non-ASCII codepoint outright,
 * because 7TV never backported the Unicode-aware alias validator it shipped for `v4`
 * (`SevenTV/SevenTV#228`, merged 2025-12-01) onto `v3`. Since #149 we write against `v4`, so that
 * rejection no longer applies — but `v4` has its own, different validator, and *that* one is what
 * this check now has to reflect.
 *
 * The `v4` rule below is evidenced from two independent directions that agree on all 25 data
 * points measured live against `7tv.io` on 2026-09-10 (docs/plans/Plan-149-7TV-v4-Schreibflaeche.md,
 * section 0/T0): 7TV's own `EmoteAliasValidator` regex, read from `SevenTV/SevenTV` at
 * `apps/api/src/http/validators.rs` —
 *
 *     ^[\w\-():!+|.'?><&\p{Emoji_Presentation}*$#]{1,100}$
 *
 * (Rust's `\w` is Unicode-aware, which is why letters of any script pass) — and a live probe of
 * that same field with 25 aliases. Both agree on what gets rejected: whitespace anywhere in the
 * alias (space, tab, newline), a zero-width space, the characters `/ \ " , ; @ % = [ ] { } ~ ^`,
 * an alias over 100 characters, and the empty string. Both agree on what gets accepted: letters of
 * any script, `ß`, emoji, and a 100-character alias.
 *
 * This check still only tests for what was actually observed rejected — a blocklist, not the
 * regex's allow-list transcribed into code. Guessing at 7TV's allowed character set has gone wrong
 * twice already in this project (#33, #37 — code and test mock shared the same wrong assumption,
 * so the tests stayed green while the behavior was broken), and the one time 7TV changed this rule
 * it only ever *loosened* it (`v3` to `v4`). A blocklist errs safe under that trend: an alias 7TV
 * newly allows that this check does not yet know about still gets flagged (an unnecessary but
 * harmless warning — this is informational only, `toAdd` is never filtered by it), where an
 * allow-list built from the regex above would instead silently wave it through on the strength of
 * a regex reading, not a probe. If a further rejection reason is observed, extend this blocklist;
 * do not turn it into a guessed-at, or even regex-transcribed, allow-list.
