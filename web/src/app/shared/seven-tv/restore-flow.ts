 * services it drives live in `core/`, and `core/` may not import from `shared/`. A service here
 * would therefore have to sit in `shared/` and be provided there, for a piece of code that holds
 * no state between calls; a function that takes its collaborators keeps the dependency edges
 * pointing the one legal way and lets every entry point pass its own injected instances.

 * Confirms and starts one restore run: 7TV token → confirmation with a live slot preview → run.

 * **The token prompt comes before the confirmation**, unlike the import flow, which asks only
 * after the confirmation (see the note on that in `startImportFlow`). Unchanged from the panel
 * this was extracted from: restoring an already-validated purge-run protocol has no read-only
 * preview step worth protecting the token prompt's ordering against — do not "align" this with
 * the import flow.
 *
 * `channelName` and `setId` are the values frozen at the moment the caller chose this file/run —
 * the flow never reads them from a live signal, so a channel switch while a dialog of this chain
 * is still open cannot change what gets restored.
