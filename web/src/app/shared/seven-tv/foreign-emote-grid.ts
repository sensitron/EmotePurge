/**
 * The selection grid for a foreign channel's 7TV set (spec Falle F4). Deliberately not the
 * `usage-stats-page.html` atlas reused: that one is keyed on our internal `emoteId` Guid and reads
 * `EmoteUsageTotal` for its bands/sparkline/fill-bar, none of which exists for a channel this
 * account has no role in. This grid owns its own `ListSelection<ForeignEmoteRow>` keyed on
 * `sevenTvEmoteId`, the 7TV ObjectID (Regel 8).
 *
 * Virtualized with `CdkVirtualScrollViewport` (HandOfBlood's set is ~956 emotes) — items are
 * chunked into fixed-column rows the same way the atlas is, and for the same reason: a *row*-level
 * `trackBy` (by index) keeps the virtualized row views stable across a resize or a sort change,
 * while the *inner* `@for` tracks each cell by `sevenTvEmoteId` so individual cells reconcile
 * correctly instead of being torn down and rebuilt — a rebuilt cell means a rebuilt
 * `app-emote-sprite`, which starts `visibility: hidden` again until it reloads, i.e. the atlas's
 * known flicker (see `usage-stats-page.ts`'s `trackRow`; this repo has hit that bug once already
 * on a virtualized grid without a stable trackBy).
 *
 * **This viewport is the only scroll container in the dialog**, and the height expression is what
 * keeps it that way. The pane around it scrolls too by default (`.app-dialog-panel`), and two nested
 * scrollbars over the same list was the reported defect; a percentage height chain is not available
 * as a fix, because it dies on the two `display: inline` component hosts between the pane and this
 * element (design language §7). So the viewport is measured against `dvh` instead:
 * `min(34rem, max(4rem, 100dvh - 26rem))`.
 *
 *  - `34rem` is the ceiling — a tall desktop screen should not turn the dialog into a wall of emotes.
 *  - `26rem` is the allowance for everything else in the pane. Measured at 22rem (the dialog chrome
 *    plus the pane's own 2rem margin), so this carries about 4rem of slack. As long as this term
 *    dominates, the content is by construction shorter than the pane and the pane cannot grow a bar.
 *  - `4rem` is a **floor, not a minimum useful size**, and it was deliberately lowered from 16rem:
 *    a floor of F re-creates the double scrollbar for every viewport below `F + 22rem`, so 16rem put
 *    the defect back on any window under ~608 px — a 1366×768 laptop, or any zoomed one. Measured at
 *    500 px the pane overflowed by 107 px. At 4rem the band is under ~416 px, i.e. shorter than the
 *    dialog's own chrome, where nothing can help.
 *
 * No positive floor removes that band entirely; only a real height chain from the pane could, and
 * that would mean making `DialogShell`'s host a flex column for all twelve of its dialogs. Not worth
 * it for a band this small — but that is the fix if the floor ever has to rise again. The numbers
 * above are pinned by an E2E case ("the grid shrinks on a short window…", `emote-import.e2e.spec.ts`)
 * because jsdom has no layout and nothing else here can see them.
