/**
 * The **one** import dialog (#147). Its first step asks where the emotes come from; the branch the
 * user picks then continues inside the same dialog.
 *
 * Before this there were two header buttons — "Importieren" (file) and "Fremder Kanal" — which broke
 * the spec's E1 ("eine Quelle unter anderen im Import-Dialog, keine eigene Seite") by giving one
 * source a front door of its own. The source choice is now the dialog's first step, so every source
 * is reached the same way and a third one is a third row rather than a third button in the header.
 *
 * Neither branch opens a dialog of its own: the file step reports its parsed result, the channel
 * step reports its picked rows, and this dialog closes with whichever came back. The chains that
 * follow (`startRestoreFlow`, `startImportFlow`) are started by the trigger *after* this dialog has
 * closed, which is what keeps the app's one-dialog-at-a-time rule intact and lets each chain keep
 * its own ordering.
 *
 * **The pane is wide exactly while the emote grid is showing.** Width belongs to the pane and not to
 * the content (§7), so the switch is an overlay panel class and not a `max-w-*` somewhere in a
 * template — but it is *not* a property of the whole dialog either: all three form states (the source
 * choice, the file branch, the channel branch before a set has loaded) carry a form's worth of content
 * and looked lost in 72rem. They stay at the ordinary 28rem.
 *
 * That leaves exactly one resize, and it coincides with "Set laden" — i.e. with a content change the
 * reader is already watching, which is the one moment a size change reads as consequence rather than
 * caprice. Nothing else moves. The trigger is therefore the grid's visibility, not the step: entering
 * the channel branch changes nothing until the set is there.
 *
 * **The action row's cast follows the same state**, and only that one: "Weiter" is absent until the
 * grid is there. Without that, the channel step carried two forward actions at once — "Set laden" at
 * the field and a permanently disabled "Weiter" in the row below — which is what made a dialog around
 * one text input look busy.
 *
 * **Focus contract: entering a step puts the caret on that step's first meaningful control.** The
 * CDK autofocuses once, when the overlay opens, and never again for a swap *inside* it — so what was
 * previously true by accident (the file dialog opened straight onto its own file button) has to be
 * said out loud now that the same content is step two. Without it a keyboard user picks a source and
 * lands on nothing, then tabs the whole dialog from the top; a mouse user sees no difference at all,
 * which is exactly why it needs a test rather than a look. Going *back* returns the caret to the
 * source row it came from — the same courtesy a menu button does when its submenu closes, and it
 * means "wrong branch, try the other one" costs no tabbing.
