/**
 * Whether the import trigger (#91, plan §1.2 point 3; #147) — the "Importieren" button in the
 * usage-stats page header, which opens the one import dialog and with it every import source —
 * should be disabled.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of this gate, because both are already enforced by the `@if` block the
 * trigger sits in on the page (`usage-stats-page.html`, the same block that gates "Übertragen"):
 * - `!isCoarse()` — no 7TV write path without a mouse (§2.5).
 * - an active 7TV set (`activeEmoteSetId()`) — there is no channel/set to validate a file against
 *   without one.
 *
 * Also deliberately NOT part of it, unlike the neighbouring "Übertragen" button this trigger
 * otherwise mirrors: `atlasOrder().length === 0`. Neither the file path nor the foreign-channel path
 * needs rows loaded in the grid — both bring their own.
 *
 * `importScopeCurrent` mirrors `importScopeIsCurrent` (`import-scope.ts`): a channel switch inside
 * the route can leave `channelName()` pointing at the new channel while the set status/rows still
 * belong to the old one. The page computes that boolean the same way it does for "Übertragen" and
 * hands it in as an input, rather than this gate recomputing it — that keeps the gate a pure
 * function taking only booleans, testable without a TestBed (same shape as `import-shortcut.ts`).
