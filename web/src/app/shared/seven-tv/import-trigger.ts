/**
 * The header button that opens the import path — **all of it** (#91, #147). It freezes
 * `channelName`/`setId` at the moment of the click, opens `ImportSourceDialog`, and hands whatever
 * comes back to the chain that fits: `startRestoreFlow` for a purge-run protocol,
 * `startImportFlow` for an emote list or usage export read from a file, and
 * `startForeignChannelImportFlow` for emotes picked out of another channel's 7TV set.
 *
 * There used to be a second header button for the foreign-channel source. It is gone: a source with
 * a front door of its own contradicted the spec's E1, and the choice now lives in the dialog's first
 * step where a third source is a third row rather than a third button (#147).
 *
 * No chain runs from inside the still-open dialog: it always closes first (its own contract, see
 * `ImportSourceDialogResult`), so the app's one-dialog-at-a-time rule (`shared/ui/dialog.ts`) holds
 * and each chain keeps its own dialog ordering — Restore asks for the 7TV token before the
 * confirmation, Import only after it (`startImportFlow`'s doc explains why; this trigger must not
 * prompt for a token itself on top of either).
 *
 * Injects its own services (#70/#91) — the page it sits in gets no new method of its own, which
 * keeps the page's own coverage surface small (see plan 2.4).
 *
 * `importScopeCurrent` is an input rather than something computed here from page state, so the
 * lock this button carries stays a pure function of two booleans (`importTriggerDisabled`,
 * testable without a TestBed) — the page computes the boolean itself, the same way it already does
 * for the neighbouring "Übertragen" button (`importScopeIsCurrent`). `atlasOrder().length === 0`
 * and `!isCoarse()` deliberately do NOT appear here: both are already enforced by the `@if` block
 * this trigger is placed inside on the page, alongside "Übertragen" (plan §1.2 point 3).
