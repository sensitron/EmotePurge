/**
 * Whether the dock's copy shortcut — the second entry point into `openImportTarget()`, sitting next
 * to "Zur Abstimmung stellen" in the mass-delete panel's `selection-actions` slot — should be
 * disabled.
 *
 * The shortcut forces `scope: 'selection'` (design doc §8.7, "erzwungener Bereich"): there is no
 * radiogroup in the target dialog to fall back to `visible`, so an empty selection is nothing to
 * act on. Beyond that it inherits every lock the header button ("Übertragen…") already
 * carries: `importScopeCurrent()` — a capture mid-channel-switch would copy channel A's emotes out
 * of A's set under B's name, see `importScopeIsCurrent` — and `SevenTvRunArbiter.activeRun()`, any
 * of the three 7TV-writing runs, not just this button's own kind.
 *
 * `!isCoarse()` and an active 7TV set deliberately do NOT appear in this state: the dock this
 * shortcut lives in is already gated on both — `usage-stats-page.html`'s
 * `@if (dockVisible() && !isCoarse())` around the whole bar, and the `@if (activeEmoteSetId(); as
 * setId)` around the marking half the mass-delete panel sits in. Repeating either here would check
 * a condition the shortcut can never actually be rendered without.
