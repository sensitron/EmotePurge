 *
 * `sevenTvEmoteId` is the 7TV ObjectID, not our internal `Emote.id` Guid (Regel 8) — it is the only
 * identity this row has, since a foreign channel has no `EmoteUsageTotal` row to key off. This is
 * why the grid needs its own `ListSelection<ForeignEmoteRow>` keyed on this field rather than the
 * `emoteId`-keyed one `usage-stats-page.ts` uses (see the spec's Falle F4).
 *
 * `topAllTime`/`trending` are 7TV-*network-wide* scores, never a channel-local popularity — there is
 * no such thing for a channel this account has no role in, `EmoteSetEmote` carries no usage data.
 * Both are `null` when 7TV reports no score for that emote. Keep the "7TV global" framing wherever
 * these are surfaced; never label them (or a sort by them) as plain "Beliebtheit" (P5').
