/**
 * Collapses the raw `AllowedRoles` bitmask into the audience the create forms offer, so the two
 * voting pages can label an existing session with it. The roles are fixed at creation and were
 * previously visible only while creating — afterwards nobody could tell a subs-only vote from an
 * open one.
 *
 * `Everyone` wins over every other flag because the server does the same: `VoteEligibilityService`
 * lets the flag through before it looks at any other role. The create paths only ever produce
 * `Everyone`, `Subs` or `Mods | Broadcaster`, but the API takes the raw flags — anything else
 * (a mixed mask, `VIPs`, an empty mask) becomes `restricted` rather than being mislabelled as one
 * of the three.
