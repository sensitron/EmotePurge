 * auth pipeline on the way, which is exactly what makes the lifetime cap a session-revocation
 * window. A *fatal* close (401/404/429/503, readyState CLOSED) is different: the browser will not
 * rebuild it, so this service does, on a capped exponential backoff (10 s, 20 s, … up to 60 s,
 * reset after the next successful `open`) rather than hammering a door that might still be shut.
 *
 * The one case that backoff must not apply to is a revoked session: retrying a 401 forever would
 * be a silent, permanent loop, since `/api/live/status` is deliberately exempt from the app-wide
 * session redirect (`EXPECTED_401_PATHS`, 2026-09-05 decision) so that a refused stream does not
 * itself bounce the tab to `/login`. This service cannot see the 401 itself (see
 * {@link fatalCloseCount}'s doc), so {@link suspendReconnecting} is the seam LiveQuotaService calls
 * once its probe confirms one — see that method for what it stops and when it resumes.
 *
 * There is no polling fallback on purpose: the failure mode is simply today's behaviour, and the
 * manual refresh button stays on every page that uses this.
