 * layout and the usage page are mounted together and listen to the same (shared) connection, so one
 * value here means one burst boundary for both. One second was the usage page's own figure and the
 * reasoning carries over unchanged — the worker flushes chat usage in 30-second batches, so pushes
 * arrive in bursts rather than continuously, and a second merges a burst without making the update
 * feel delayed. Against a 7TV mass delete (one event every ~275 ms) it collapses the whole run into
 * one or two refetches, because the window only elapses in a gap.
 *
 * The vote-session detail page keeps its own, shorter 500 ms window on purpose: a live tally is the
 * thing its user is watching, and it is never mounted while the mass-delete panel runs.
