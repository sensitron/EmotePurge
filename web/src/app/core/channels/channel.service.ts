   * The one permission read for a channel. Succeeds for every logged-in user (it reports what they
   * may do, it does not gate on it), so callers read the flags — they must not treat a 403 as
   * "not allowed", the way the probe calls this replaced had to.
   *
   * Cached per channel for {@link PERMISSIONS_TTL_MS}, because opening a channel asks three
   * independent times: the route guard, the workspace layout, and the page's own resource. All
   * three are legitimate — each needs the answer for its own decision — but on the wire they were
   * three identical requests, and each one costs a live Twitch/7TV role check server-side plus a
   * permit from the 40/min `ExternalApi` limiter. That is what made ordinary clicking-around hit
   * 429; the limit had already been doubled once for the same symptom, which is the sign that the
   * requests, not the ceiling, were the problem. `shareReplay` also covers the in-flight case, so
   * the three readers of a single navigation share one response even before the TTL matters.
   *
   * Deliberately NOT extended to `listMine()`: the overview refetches that on live events, and a
   * cache would answer those refetches with the very state they were sent to replace.
   *
   * One behavioural consequence for callers: a cache hit emits **synchronously** on subscribe,
   * where the bare HTTP call always emitted later. `ChannelWorkspaceLayout` subscribes from inside
   * an `effect()`, so its signal writes now happen during that effect rather than after it — which
   * is allowed, and holds because the signals it writes are not the ones the effect reads. A future
   * caller that subscribes from a `computed()` would not be so lucky.
