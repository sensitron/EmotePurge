// Local pre-flight check that estimates whether the current branch would pass SonarCloud's
// Quality Gate condition "coverage on new code >= 80%" (see .github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml)
// — WITHOUT calling SonarCloud at all. Meant to be run before pushing/opening a PR, so a
// coverage shortfall is visible locally instead of only after CI/SonarCloud comes back red.
//
// APPROXIMATION — READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING A GREEN RESULT:
// SonarCloud's "new code" coverage is computed LINE-BY-LINE: it diffs against the base branch
// (via git blame) and only counts lines that are actually new/changed as the denominator. This
// script approximates that at FILE granularity instead: for every file touched on this branch,
// it takes that file's *entire* coverage (from the same OpenCover/lcov reports Sonar itself would
// read) as a stand-in for "new code coverage" of that file. Line-accurate diffing was
// deliberately not attempted here — re-implementing Sonar's blame-based new-code detection would
// be its own non-trivial piece of software with its own failure modes, and a wrong "close
// approximation" is worse than an honest coarse one.
//
// Lines AND branches both count, but this is still not Sonar's formula. Sonar's own coverage
// number is (CT + CF + LC) / (2*B + EL) — covered true/false branch outcomes plus covered lines,
// over twice the branch count plus executable lines. This script instead counts (covered lines +
// covered branches) / (executable lines + total branches), read straight from the OpenCover
// SequencePoint/BranchPoint and lcov DA/BRDA records. That is CLOSER to Sonar than lines alone —
// a line can be fully "hit" while one of its branches is never taken (see docs/DECISIONS.md's
// rule-12 entry: "135 ungedeckt (dazu 20 von 144 Bedingungen)" for a real example of that gap —
// but it is not a reimplementation of Sonar's exact weighting, just a same-shaped approximation
// with one more input than before.
//
// What this means in practice:
//   - Brand-new files: the approximation is close to accurate (nearly all lines ARE new).
//   - A single new/changed line dropped into a large, already well-tested file: this script
//     will report that file's overall (mostly old, mostly covered) percentage, which can look
//     fine while SonarCloud reports 0% new-code coverage for the same file, because only that
//     one new line counts there. This is the direction where this script can give a false
//     "all clear" that SonarCloud then contradicts.
//   - The opposite also happens: a file with a poor OVERALL percentage (lots of old, untested
//     code) whose few new lines happen to be exactly the ones covered by a new test would score
//     red here while SonarCloud scores that same diff 100% (only the new lines count there).
//   - Weighting, not just per-file scoring, is skewed: since the frontend run is forced to
//     include every production file (--coverage-include), a large untouched-but-untested file
//     with only a handful of changed lines enters the denominator with its FULL line and branch
//     count. Measured example: usage-stats-page.ts contributes 0/391 lines + 0/178 branches here
//     while Sonar would weigh roughly the 166 lines the diff actually touched. Both call it 0%,
//     but this script lets it drag the overall figure down much harder than Sonar does.
// Neither direction is bounded — this is a genuine approximation, not a safe upper or lower
// bound on what SonarCloud will report. Treat a green result as "probably fine, not a
// guarantee" (especially for small, surgical diffs into large files), and treat a red result as
// "worth a closer look", not as proof SonarCloud will also fail the gate.
//
// A changed file that never appears in either report at all (no test imports it, e.g. a brand
// new component with no spec yet) is NOT silently treated as 0% or 100% — it is listed
// separately as "not measured", and its presence forces the overall verdict to stay cautious
// (see the "incomplete" handling in main()) even when the measured files alone would clear
// the threshold. Deliberately no heuristic tries to guess which unmeasured files are "probably
// fine" (e.g. type-only/interface files with nothing to execute) — such a heuristic would
// eventually misclassify a file that DOES have real logic, and it would do so silently, exactly
// where nobody would notice. An honest "can't tell, a human should look" beats a guess that is
// wrong occasionally and invisibly.
//
// The frontend run also passes `--coverage-include=src/**/*.ts` (see runFrontendTests below),
// on top of what .github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml itself runs. That flag only affects the lcov
// report THIS script reads locally — it is not added to angular.json or to the CI workflow, so
// the coverage number SonarCloud actually sees is unaffected. It shrinks (does not eliminate)
// the "not measured" blind spot: Vitest's default coverage.include only reports files that some
// test actually imported, so a completely untested new file simply never appears in lcov.info
// and this script couldn't have told "file has no data" apart from "file wasn't touched by any
// test" without it. With the broader include, such a file now shows up with 0% instead of
// vanishing — verified live against mass-delete-panel.ts (see the coordinator's requested
// verification).
//
// Required tools: git, dotnet, npm (unless the corresponding side is skipped).
// Docker must be running for the backend side (dotnet test uses Testcontainers).

//   --skip-tests      Don't run the test suites; just read whatever reports are already on disk.
//   --backend-only    Only run/evaluate the .NET (OpenCover) side.
//   --frontend-only   Only run/evaluate the Angular (lcov) side.
