# Operations

The parts of running this project that live as code in this repository: what the API expects
from whatever reverse proxy sits in front of it, the backup script and how to restore from what
it produces, and how to reach a local development build from a phone. No particular hosting
setup is assumed.

## Running behind a reverse proxy

The API process serves both the JSON API and the Angular SPA from `wwwroot/`; there is no
separate frontend process to proxy. It listens on `:8080` inside the container and on `:5151`
locally. TLS is terminated by the proxy — the app calls no `UseHttpsRedirection()`, because
Kestrel only ever listens on plain HTTP. Five contracts matter, each enforced or relied on by
code in `src/EmotePurge.Api/`:

- **The application sets its own security headers.** `Program.cs` writes
  `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`
  and `Content-Security-Policy` on every response. Setting them again in the proxy produces
  duplicates; a site-wide header block applied to all virtual hosts must exclude this one.
- **Buffering must be off for the Server-Sent-Events streams.** The API sets
  `X-Accel-Buffering: no` on SSE responses (`Endpoints/LiveEndpoints.cs`), which nginx and
  compatible proxies honour, but set the equivalent explicitly too (`proxy_buffering off` for
  `/api/`). Without it the live stream stays invisible until a buffer fills — which looks like
  a broken feature, not a proxy setting.
- **The read timeout has to outlast an idle stream.** The broker injects a heartbeat every 15
  seconds (`HeartbeatInterval` in `Infrastructure/Redis/RedisLiveEventStream.cs`); nginx
  defaults to 60. Raise it generously for the SSE paths rather than relying on the heartbeat
  staying under a default somebody may lower.
- **`X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-For` must be set.** The auth cookie uses
  `CookieSecurePolicy.Always`, the OAuth state cookie in `Endpoints/AuthEndpoints.cs` uses
  `Secure = Request.IsHttps`. Dropping `X-Forwarded-Proto` makes login fail visibly — the
  intended failure mode, chosen over silently issuing a session cookie without `Secure`.
- **Do not expose the container port beyond loopback.** `app.UseForwardedHeaders` runs with
  empty `KnownProxies` and `KnownIPNetworks`, i.e. it trusts forwarded headers from any sender.
  That is only sound while the local proxy is the only party able to reach the port; in
  `docker-compose.prod.yml` it is published as `127.0.0.1:<port>:8080`. Binding it to
  `0.0.0.0` turns blind trust into a spoofable one.

Three smaller points. Responses under `/api` carry `Cache-Control: no-store` (`Program.cs`) as
per-user, cookie-authenticated data — do not cache those paths at the proxy. Enable HTTP/2
explicitly if the proxy does not: under HTTP/1.1 the six-connections-per-origin limit applies,
and several tabs holding open SSE streams can starve each other. And the API rate-limits per
user, answering `429` (`RejectionStatusCode` in `Program.cs`), while a limit added at the proxy
usually answers differently — nginx `limit_req` returns `503` — so the status code tells you
which layer rejected a throttled client. No raw WebSocket endpoint exists; SSE needs no
`Upgrade` handling.

## Database backup and restore

[`scripts/backup-postgres.sh`](../scripts/backup-postgres.sh) dumps the database and rotates
old dumps. It runs on the **host**, not in a container: it shells out to `docker exec` against
the running Postgres container, so `docker` must be on `PATH` and the invoking user allowed to
run `docker exec`/`docker inspect`. It writes `<prefix>-<date>_<time>.sql.gz` into
`BACKUP_DIR`, dumping into a `.tmp` file first and renaming it with an atomic `mv` only after
`pg_dump`'s exit code and a non-empty size check both pass. That is the point of the script: a
plain `pg_dump | gzip > file.gz` exits 0 even when `pg_dump` failed midway, leaving a
valid-looking but truncated archive. Rotation only ever deletes files matching the script's own
name pattern.

| Variable | Default | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `POSTGRES_CONTAINER` | `emotepurge-postgres` | `container_name` in `docker-compose.prod.yml` |
| `POSTGRES_USER` | `emotepurge` | `POSTGRES_USER` in `.env.example` |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | `emotepurge` | hardcoded as `POSTGRES_DB` in both compose files |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `/var/backups/emotepurge` | operational choice, not defined elsewhere in the repo |
| `RETENTION_DAYS` | `14` | operational choice, not defined elsewhere in the repo |
| `BACKUP_FILE_PREFIX` | `emotepurge` | also the pattern rotation matches against |
| `OFFSITE_ENABLED` | `0` | optional `rclone` copy, off by default |
| `OFFSITE_RCLONE_REMOTE` | *(empty)* | e.g. `b2:my-bucket/emotepurge` |

A dump contains user records including stored Twitch tokens; restrict the target directory
(`chmod 700`). The optional off-site step copies the finished dump with
[`rclone`](https://rclone.org/) and only logs a warning if `rclone` is missing or the remote
unset, because a broken off-site leg must never mark a successful local backup as failed. A
dump on the same machine as the database it protects guards only against mistakes *inside* that
system — deletion, volume corruption, a failed upgrade — never against loss of the machine.

A single nightly cron entry is enough; backup and rotation happen in the same run. Two things
about `/etc/cron.d` files bite reliably, neither with an error message: those files do **not**
inherit `PATH` from `/etc/crontab` (cron gives them only `/usr/bin:/bin`, so the script aborts
nightly at its own `command -v docker` check if `docker` lives elsewhere), and cron silently
ignores files there that are group- or world-writable or not owned by root. Run the script by
hand once before scheduling it, and verify the schedule by moving it a couple of minutes into
the future instead of waiting for the real time — which is server time.

### Restore drill

Checking that the dumps are worth anything, without touching the live database and without
stopping API or worker: load one into a throwaway database on the same container, then drop it.

```sh
docker exec emotepurge-postgres psql -U emotepurge -d postgres \
  -c 'CREATE DATABASE emotepurge_restoretest OWNER emotepurge;'
gunzip -c <dump>.sql.gz \
  | docker exec -i emotepurge-postgres psql -U emotepurge -d emotepurge_restoretest -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -q
echo "exit code: $?"
docker exec emotepurge-postgres psql -U emotepurge -d postgres \
  -c 'DROP DATABASE emotepurge_restoretest;'
```

**Without `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` the drill is worthless:** `psql` otherwise skips past errors and
still exits 0, so a restore missing tables would look successful. Expect exit code 0 and no
output. Comparing row counts against the live database is a useful second step, but differences
are normal: `UsageStats` and `Votes` keep growing (the flush runs every 30 seconds), and
`__EFMigrationsHistory` is behind if a migration was added after the dump was taken.

### Restoring for real

Both real restore paths start by stopping the writers — API and worker write continuously
(chat-match flush, 7TV resync, join/leave), and leaving either running invites race conditions.
`pg_dump --format=plain`, which the script uses, contains no `DROP` statements, so replaying
into a non-empty database fails with `already exists`. Drop and recreate first, connected to
the `postgres` maintenance database because a database cannot drop itself:

```sh
docker stop emotepurge-api emotepurge-worker
docker exec -i emotepurge-postgres psql -U emotepurge -d postgres -c "DROP DATABASE emotepurge;"
docker exec -i emotepurge-postgres psql -U emotepurge -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE emotepurge OWNER emotepurge;"
gunzip -c <dump>.sql.gz | docker exec -i emotepurge-postgres psql -U emotepurge -d emotepurge
docker start emotepurge-api emotepurge-worker
```

A successful run is an unbroken series of `CREATE TABLE`/`COPY`/`ALTER TABLE` confirmations —
scroll the output for `ERROR:` lines.

**After the volume is gone** the sequence differs. With `postgres-data` missing, bringing the
stack up makes the Postgres image create a fresh empty volume and an empty `emotepurge`
database from the `POSTGRES_DB`/`POSTGRES_USER` variables — without schema, since the EF Core
migrations do not run at app start. Start Postgres alone, wait for its healthcheck to report
healthy, then replay the dump straight into that empty database: no drop/recreate is needed,
because a plain-format dump carries the full schema **and** the EF Core migration history. Then
start API and worker. Only if migrations were added after the dump was taken does
`dotnet ef database update` (see `CLAUDE.md`, "EF Core Migrationen") have to follow.

`postgres-data` is not the only stateful volume: `dataprotection-keys` holds the ASP.NET Core
Data Protection keyring, and losing it signs every user out (see `docker-compose.prod.yml`).

## Testing on a device in your own network

To check the app on a real phone — touch behaviour, `pointer: coarse` layouts, sheet dialogs —
without deploying and without a cable. There is deliberately no staging stage: this *is* the
local development environment under a different name, with the same database, the same test
data, hot reload and a real Twitch login.

```
docker compose up -d postgres redis
dotnet run --project src/EmotePurge.Api --launch-profile lan
__VITE_ADDITIONAL_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS=your.host.example npm --prefix web run start:lan
```

**Two things carry your hostname, and neither of them is a tracked file.** The repository is
public, so it holds no hostname at all.

- **API:** the `lan` profile sets only the flag `EMOTEPURGE_LAN`. The hostname itself lives in
  `src/EmotePurge.Api/appsettings.Lan.json`, which is gitignored. Create it once with
  `cp src/EmotePurge.Api/appsettings.Lan.json.example src/EmotePurge.Api/appsettings.Lan.json`
  and put your hostname in both values. Without the file the profile still starts and falls
  back to the `localhost` redirect URI, so login fails visibly rather than silently doing
  something else. The file is excluded from `dotnet publish` and from the Docker build context,
  so it cannot be baked into an image.
- **Dev server:** pass your hostname in `__VITE_ADDITIONAL_SERVER_ALLOWED_HOSTS`, as above.
  The `lan` configuration deliberately does **not** set `allowedHosts`, which leaves it as the
  empty array Vite needs before it will read that variable. Do not reach for
  `ng serve --allowed-hosts` instead: the Angular CLI exposes that option only as a boolean, so
  it turns host checking off altogether and disables Vite's protection against DNS rebinding —
  a page you open in any browser could then resolve its own name to your machine and talk to
  the dev server. The variable is Vite-internal (hence the two underscores) and could disappear
  on a major upgrade; if it does, the fallback is a local, uncommitted `allowedHosts` entry in
  `angular.json`.

Both `lan` variants are purely additive — plain `dotnet run` and `npm --prefix web start`
behave exactly as before, and `appsettings.Development.json` is untouched. They differ from the
everyday start in two ways: the Angular dev server listens on all network interfaces instead of
`localhost` only, and the API's Twitch redirect URI and post-login redirect point at the
hostname you reach the machine under instead of `localhost`. Reaching that from a phone takes
three things, whatever software you use for them:

1. A hostname inside your own network resolving to the development machine, and a proxy in
   front of it terminating TLS and forwarding to the dev server on `:4200`. HTTPS is not
   optional: the auth cookie is `Secure`-only, so the app does not work over plain `http://`.
2. That proxy passing `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` through, and supporting WebSockets. Without
   the header the OAuth state cookie loses its `Secure` flag and login fails with
   `InvalidOAuthState`; without WebSockets the Vite HMR socket cannot connect and the phone
   stops live-reloading (the environment stays usable — reload by hand).
3. The same redirect URI registered in the Twitch application you develop against, character
   for character: scheme, host and path, no trailing slash. A mismatch is answered by Twitch,
   not by this app, so the error can surface on a completely different machine.

Only `/` goes through that proxy. `/api` stays on the Angular dev proxy
(`web/proxy.conf.json` → `:5151`), which keeps the topology identical to working at the desk
and everything same-origin: no CORS, no `withCredentials`. The worker is not started by the
three commands above; run it separately if you need chat counting or 7TV sync.

Four failures worth recognising:

- **"Blocked request" from the dev server.** The Vite-based dev server rejects `Host` headers
  it was not told to accept, and by default only `localhost`/`.localhost`/IPs are allowed. Make
  sure you started it through `npm --prefix web run start:lan`, not plain `npm start` — only the
  former passes `--allowed-hosts` (see `web/package.json`), which for this one script accepts
  any host. That is a deliberate trade against DNS-rebinding protection, acceptable only because
  the dev server is never reachable outside your own network in the first place.
- **Assets served stale, or a lazy chunk failing with `504`.** If the proxy caches assets, a
  moment where the dev server was down puts those errors into the cache with an expiry, and the
  affected chunk stays dead while others keep working. Asset caching is wrong in front of a dev
  server whose chunk hashes change on every rebuild — turn it off.
- **The phone shows an old version even after a hard reload.** Same cause one layer out: those
  assets came with a `Cache-Control` max-age and now live in the *browser*, so turning the proxy
  option off does not recall them. Clear the site data on the device. When a change refuses to
  show up, put a visible probe in the page (a colour, a border) before measuring behaviour.
- **Test data missing.** Then `dotnet run` points at a different database than the compose
  stack: the password in `appsettings.json` has to match `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env`.
