/// This response is the one place in the API where the payload is encoded rather than merely
/// serialized: day offsets instead of ISO dates, pairs instead of objects, emotes without usage
/// omitted entirely. All three exist to keep a whole-set response small, and all three are read on
/// the other side by hand-written TypeScript (<c>ChannelUsageSeries</c> in
/// <c>web/src/app/core/usage-stats/usage-stat.model.ts</c>). A well-meant "cleanup" that turned the
/// pairs into a record would keep C# compiling, keep every other test green, and leave the atlas's
/// sidecar drawing flat lines — so the encoding is asserted here rather than assumed.
