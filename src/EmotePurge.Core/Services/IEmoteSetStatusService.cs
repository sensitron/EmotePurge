/// The set's slot limit as 7TV last reported it, or <c>null</c> when it did not report one.
/// Consumers must render no budget at all in that case rather than assuming 1000 — 7TV subscribers

/// Counted from our own emote rows, not from 7TV's <c>emote_count</c>. The two agree right after
/// every full sync anyway (the sync reconciles onto exactly that list), but between syncs only our
/// count reflects the EventAPI deltas that have already arrived — and it is the number the user
/// sees in the grid below the bar.

/// Since when this channel's usage data can be trusted: the last join that reactivated the channel,
/// or its creation if it was never left and rejoined. Older than this, we simply were not counting.

/// <param name="SyncFailureReason">
/// One of <see cref="SevenTvSyncFailureReasons"/>, or <c>null</c> when the last sync attempt
/// succeeded — or when none has been made yet. Together with an empty
/// <paramref name="ActiveEmoteSetId"/> that absence is what tells "the first sync is still running"
/// apart from "this channel has no active emote set on 7TV", which used to look identical.

/// When the last attempt finished, successful or not. <c>null</c> means none has been made. Read

/// The earliest UTC day on which this channel has a <c>UsageStat</c> row with <c>BotUseCount &gt;
/// 0</c> — the first time a bot was <em>seen</em> here, not the day bot usage started being
/// counted apart. That separation began the moment this feature was deployed, which is an event
/// in the deploy history, not in the data: rows written before and after look identical when
/// <c>BotUseCount</c> happens to be 0, so there is no way to derive the true cutover from the
/// data alone. For a channel joined long before the deploy, this understates how far back the
/// mixing goes; for one joined after, it can wrongly suggest older numbers are mixed when they
/// never were. <c>null</c> means no bot has ever been seen here, in which case there is nothing
/// to explain and a consumer should show nothing — except that, since #73, <c>BotUseCount</c>
/// only counts bots seen in the channel's own room (mirrored "shared chat" bots land in
/// <c>SharedChatUseCount</c> instead), so a channel first tracked only after that deploy whose bot
/// traffic is effectively all mirrored keeps this <c>null</c> forever even though bots are in fact
/// excluded: a known, accepted gap (DECISIONS.md, D2), not evidence the channel never saw a bot.

/// <paramref name="BotsExcludedSince"/> and for the same reason: the separation began with a
/// deploy, an event in the deploy history and not in the data. Numbers for days before this one
/// carry usage from other channels' shared chat inside <c>UseCount</c>, indistinguishably — that is
/// what a consumer has to say when it shows this date. <c>null</c> means no shared chat has ever
/// been seen here: nothing was separated away for this channel, so a consumer shows nothing. Note
/// what <c>null</c> does <em>not</em> mean — the separation itself applies to every channel, so a
/// later consumer must not read it as "shared chat is still counted here".
