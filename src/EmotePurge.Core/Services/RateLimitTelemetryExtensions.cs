/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Awaiting a counter would put a Redis round trip into the request path of the very endpoints this
/// round exists to make cheaper: one on every rate-limited request, one on every provider call, one on
/// every cache lookup. Not awaiting it, on the other hand, is how an unobserved faulted task is
/// created — so the discarding happens here, once and deliberately, rather than as a bare <c>_ =</c>
/// at six call sites where the next reader cannot tell an intention from an oversight.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Two failure modes are covered, and they are not the same one. A sink that throws <em>before</em>
/// returning a task cannot be caught by an <c>await</c> that never happens — hence the try/catch. A
/// sink that returns a task which faults later leaks an unobserved exception unless someone looks at
/// it — hence the continuation. The store's own contract promises neither case can occur; this holds
/// for every other implementation too, including a test double and whatever is registered next.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Swallowed silently on purpose: the only implementation that can fail meaningfully already logs its
/// own failures with a structured German line, and a logger here would drag a logging package into
/// <c>EmotePurge.Core</c>, which is BCL-only by rule.
