/// running alongside the new one for a brief window, and both can hand fragments of different
/// lines to the same parser.
/// <para>
/// This reads <c>ChatMessage.RawIrcMessage</c>, not <c>ChatMessage.UndocumentedTags</c> (E6). A splice
/// that lands inside the *value* of a typed tag — e.g. <c>subscriber=0@badge-info=</c>, where the
/// second line's tag block starts mid-value — never surfaces as a second dictionary key: TwitchLib's
/// tag parser splits the tag block on <c>;</c>, so the extra <c>@…</c> stays swallowed inside the
/// value of the tag it landed in. Only the raw, unparsed line still shows the second <c>@</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A bare second <c>@</c> is *not* the marker — that was the first attempt and it was wrong. The
/// IRCv3 tag escaping only replaces <c>;</c>, space, <c>\</c>, CR and LF, so <c>@</c> survives
/// unescaped inside a tag value, and Twitch's reply UI puts one there in every single reply:
/// <c>reply-parent-msg-body</c> carries the parent message verbatim, and that message usually
/// starts with the <c>@nutzername</c> the UI prepended. Two things separate the two cases:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>A splice continues with a *new tag block*, i.e. a tag key followed by <c>=</c>
/// (<c>@badge-info=</c>); a mention continues with a login and then hits a separator without ever
/// reaching an <c>=</c>. Hence <see cref="ContainsTagBlockStart"/>.</item>
/// <item>The value of a free-text tag (<c>*msg-body</c>) is chat text under a stranger's control
/// and can imitate anything, including <c>@badge-info=</c>. It is therefore skipped entirely —
/// see the blind spot below.</item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The rule cannot fire on the two other places a line legitimately carries a second <c>@</c>: the
/// IRC prefix (<c>nick!user@host</c>) and an <c>@user</c> mention in the message text both sit
/// after the first space, i.e. outside the tag block this rule inspects.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Known lower bound: a splice severe enough to make the line unparsable never reaches
/// <see cref="TwitchChatManager.OnMessageReceived"/> at all (TwitchLib drops it before raising the
/// event), so this rule — and the counter it feeds — undercounts the true splice rate. Skipping
/// free-text values widens that undercount by one case: a splice landing inside a
/// <c>reply-parent-msg-body</c> value goes unseen. That is deliberate — the alternative is a
/// sentinel any chatter can trigger by typing <c>@badge-info=</c>, which would make the instrument
/// useless in the other direction. It proves the defect exists; it does not measure it exhaustively.
