/// <para>
/// <b>Why 30 s and not 7TV's 60 s.</b> The cap is the maximum *additional* counting gap after a
/// Twitch outage has already ended: once Twitch is back, the next attempt notices within one capped
/// interval plus its own duration. A 7TV outage costs no counting at all (the periodic REST resync
/// covers it), so 7TV can afford to wait longer between attempts; a Twitch outage costs live chat
/// every second it lasts, so the ceiling stays where TwitchLib's own reconnect policy already sat
/// without ever drawing Twitch's attention.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the failure streak counts attempts, not sessions.</b> The first draft of this policy
/// treated any session shorter than 60 s as a failure, to guard against session churn. The
/// adversarial review of the design (2026-09-08, finding G1) showed that rule would cost sustained
/// flapping 34–47 s per event instead of today's ~14 s, and that its premise — Twitch treats fast
/// reconnects as abuse — was itself superseded by the 2026-07-30 fix for the ten-attempts trap in
/// the previous default policy. A session that came up and went straight back down is not a failed
/// attempt; it is a session, and it resets the failure streak like any other.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the flap dampening is a floor, not a second backoff.</b> Without any damping, a
/// connection Twitch tears down immediately after every handshake would loop at roughly the 2 s
/// signal-to-004 period — about 1,800 rebuilds and log lines per hour. A flat 5 s floor from the
/// third consecutive short session onward bounds that to ≤ 720/h. It never grows on its own and it
/// is lifted the moment a session holds for 60 s; it stacks with the exponential backoff only as a
/// lower bound (a maximum of the two), never as its own exponent.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why 5 s is caution, not calibration.</b> Whether and at what rate Twitch actually rejects fast
/// anonymous reconnects has never been measured (concept 7.8); the 2026-07-27 "abuse detection"
/// read of an earlier outage was itself explained away by the ten-attempts trap above. The floor
/// exists to protect our own log and our own event loop from a tight cycle, not because Twitch is
