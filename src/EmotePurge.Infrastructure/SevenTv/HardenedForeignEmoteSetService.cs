/// The hardening decorator around the foreign-channel-import preview (spec 2026-09-09, T2/section 6):
/// wraps the raw <see cref="ForeignEmoteSetService"/> resolution chain with the 60 s cache (E3),
/// request coalescing, the 429-aware circuit breaker (E4) and the provider-wide budget (E5b) — in
/// that order, one process-wide instance of each collaborator shared across every request.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Order of guards.</b> The cache is checked first and, on a hit, short-circuits everything below
/// it — no coalescing key is even taken. A miss (or <c>refresh: true</c>, which always skips the
/// cache) enters the coalescer, so concurrent identical lookups share one execution of the breaker
/// and budget gate below rather than each consulting them separately. Only inside that shared
/// execution does the breaker decide whether to allow an attempt at all, and only if it does does the
/// budget gate wait for one of the two concurrency slots before the raw chain is actually invoked.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The other half of the budget is not taken here.</b> This decorator admits whole lookups
/// (<see cref="ForeignEmoteSetProviderBudget.TryAcquireConcurrencySlotAsync"/>); the rolling
/// 60-requests-a-minute limit is charged one permit at a time by the steps that actually issue an
/// upstream request, because a single lookup issues up to twelve of them. Taking both here would make
/// one permit stand for a whole resolution — the shape Codex found, and the reason this feature could
/// have made up to 720 upstream requests a minute against a limit of 60.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Every reachable path through <see cref="ExecuteGuardedAsync"/> resolves the breaker's probe
/// state exactly once</b> whenever <see cref="ForeignSevenTvBreakerPolicy.TryAcquire"/> returned
/// <c>Allowed: true</c> — via <see cref="ForeignSevenTvBreakerPolicy.RecordSuccess"/>,
/// <see cref="ForeignSevenTvBreakerPolicy.RecordFailure"/>, or, for an outcome that says nothing
/// about 7TV's health (a budget timeout, or a lookup that never reached 7TV in the first place — see
/// <see cref="ApplyBreakerFeedback"/>), <see cref="ForeignSevenTvBreakerPolicy.ReleaseProbeWithoutOutcome"/>.
/// The <c>finally</c> block is the backstop for anything unexpected that still manages to skip all of
/// those — without it, a single truly unforeseen exception during the probe's one allowed attempt
/// would leave the breaker stuck open forever, since no later caller is ever let through to prove it
