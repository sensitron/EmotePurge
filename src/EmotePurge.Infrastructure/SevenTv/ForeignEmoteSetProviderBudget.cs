/// hardening decorator), and at most <see cref="MaxRequestsPerWindow"/> upstream <i>requests</i> may
/// start within any rolling <see cref="Window"/> (<see cref="TryChargeRequestAsync(CancellationToken)"/>,
/// taken by each step that actually issues one). They were a single call until Codex pointed out that
/// this collapses the two units: one resolution is up to twelve requests, so charging the window once
/// per resolution allowed up to twelve times the documented rate.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Rolling, not fixed.</b> The window is a queue of the timestamps of the last
/// <see cref="MaxRequestsPerWindow"/> permits, not a counter reset wholesale at a boundary. A fixed
/// window lets 60 permits just before the boundary and 60 more just after it pass as "60 a minute",
/// which is ~120 in the rolling minute that straddles it — precisely the burst this limit exists to
/// keep off 7TV. The spec says "60 Upstream-Requests/Minute" without spelling out which reading it
/// means, so this is not a contract correction; it is the reading that serves the limit's stated
/// purpose. Bounded memory: the queue never holds more than <see cref="MaxRequestsPerWindow"/> entries.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Waits, does not reject (E5).</b> Unlike the ASP.NET rate-limit policies elsewhere in this
/// codebase, exceeding either limit here does not produce an immediate rejection — it makes the
/// caller wait for a slot, up to the timeout it passed. Only a caller that is still waiting when that
/// timeout elapses is refused, which maps to the spec's "Unavailable" outcome.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>In-process, deliberately.</b> Same limitation as the Twitch token refresh's in-process lock
/// (see <c>docs/DECISIONS.md</c>): with more than one API replica each would hold its own budget, so
/// the real ceiling would be <c>replicas × (MaxConcurrent, MaxRequestsPerWindow)</c>. Acceptable
/// today because there is exactly one replica; a second would need a distributed version of this.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Not a "pure" policy like <see cref="ForeignSevenTvBreakerPolicy"/> — E4 asks specifically for
/// that shape, E5 does not, and a concurrency/rate gate is inherently about coordinating real
/// waiting, not a stateless decision function.
