/// <remarks>
/// A policy name is a string in three unrelated spots: the registration in <c>Program.cs</c>, the
/// <c>RequireRateLimiting</c> call on every route it guards, and the rejection log an operator reads
/// when a 429 shows up. Typed out three times, a rename silently unhooks routes — ASP.NET Core does
/// not fail a build over a policy name no registration answers, it throws at the first request
/// against that route. Referencing the constants makes the compiler the guard instead, and lets the
/// tests assert the name the code actually uses rather than a re-typed copy of it.
